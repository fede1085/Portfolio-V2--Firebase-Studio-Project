Proficiency with platforms like Microsoft 365, Copilot, and Power BI is frequently requested, often in insurance, finance, or consulting[^3_1].
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI) Consultant / AI Business Analyst:** Common in consultancy firms and large enterprises, these roles analyze workflow bottlenecks, recommend automation strategies, and help with the adoption of no-code/low-code platforms. They often bridge IT with business functions and work closely with sales, HR, finance, and administration departments[^3_2][^3_3].
- **Microsoft 365 Productivity Expert / AI Productivity Specialist:** Roles that integrate and automate tools within existing productivity suites (e.g., Microsoft 365), focusing on enhancing efficiency in non-technical departments by automating routine processes and training business users[^3_4].
- **AI Expert (Marketing, HR, R\&D):** Specialized roles within departments such as marketing or R\&D, responsible for designing AI solutions that automate campaign execution, improve data-driven decision-making, and augment existing team capabilities using chatbots, recommendation engines, and workflow automations[^3_5][^3_6].
- **Business Intelligence Manager / Data \& Analytics Manager:** These titles sometimes overlap with automation consultant roles—introducing advanced analytics, dashboarding, and automation to replace legacy manual processes in various business departments[^3_7].


### Trends and Market Signals

- There is a **clear trend toward the integration of AI and automation consultants** within non-tech departments to facilitate the adoption of AI-driven and low-code solutions. This is visible in open vacancies, with job titles adjusted to emphasize functional, communication, and training skills in addition to technical expertise[^3_2][^3_1].
- Consulting firms specializing in **intelligent automation and AI deployment** are expanding their service offerings to include staff enablement and business process redesign for clients, showing that the demand is not limited to pure IT roles but is growing in sales, HR, administration, and other operational areas[^3_3][^3_8].
- **Digital marketing, insurance, finance, and manufacturing** have been early and notable adopters. AI productivity roles tailored to these fields commonly involve workflow automation, process reengineering, and leveraging AI for content, analytics, or compliance automation[^3_5][^3_9][^3_6].

Belgium’s non-technical sectors—such as administration, sales, logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, and government—are already adopting or preparing for deeper automation and AI integration. Several key trends are expected to reshape the skill landscape through 2030:

### 1. Hyperautomation and Process Redesign

- **Hyperautomation**—the end-to-end automation of complex business processes using a mix of AI, robotics (RPA), and low-code/no-code tools—is gathering pace. This goes beyond automating individual tasks, targeting entire workflows and connecting siloed business functions[^5_1][^5_2][^5_3].
- **Implication:** Demand for professionals who can orchestrate these interconnected automations with business know-how and tool integration skills (not just IT specialists) will grow.


### 2. AI and Advanced Analytics Everywhere

- Non-tech industries now deploy AI for tasks like document processing, process validation, predictive maintenance, asset auditing, and even customer/emotional experience management[^5_4][^5_5][^5_6].
- New jobs and upskilling needs are emerging for roles that use, interpret, and improve AI tools (including generative AI), not just for those who build them. This includes training non-technical staff to collaborate with AI.


### 3. Low-code/No-code Democratization

- More companies are empowering business employees (citizen developers) to build their own automations using drag-and-drop platforms, without needing software engineering expertise[^5_2][^5_3][^5_7].
- Skills in workflow design, data flow mapping, and tool adoption (Power Platform, Make, n8n, etc.) will become essential across job families.


### 4. Emphasis on Human-AI Collaboration

- Rather than replacing jobs, automation in Belgium is forecast to augment roles: making teams more productive, dynamic, and focused on higher-value work[^5_8][^5_9].
- Soft skills (communication, critical thinking, adaptability) and emotional intelligence are increasingly sought after, as employees shift to managing, validating, and collaborating with AI-driven systems rather than performing repetitive tasks[^5_10][^5_11].


### 5. Digital and Data Fluency

- The government’s 2030 Digital Roadmap aims for 80% of Belgians to have at least basic digital skills by the end of the decade, with a special push in business and government[^5_12][^5_13][^5_14].
- Handling, interpreting, and acting on digital and data outputs will be indispensable, even outside classic tech jobs.


### 6. Change Management and Training

- Non-tech industries need experts who can train, onboard, and support colleagues in adopting new tools and AI platforms. Change management is as important as technical deployment to ensure automation success[^5_9][^5_3].


### 7. Regulatory, Security, and Ethical Compliance

- As AI and automation expand, skills related to data governance, process compliance, and privacy will become crucial across non-tech environments[^5_1][^5_15].


## What This Means for Skills in Demand

| Emerging Focus Areas | Skills Needed |
| :-- | :-- |
| Hyperautomation \& workflow orchestration | Low-code automation, business process mapping, RPA platform skills, cross-tool integrations |
| AI-adoption in non-tech roles | Prompt engineering, data interpretation, human-in-the-loop AI, outcome validation |
| Digital transformation \& data fluency | Digital literacy, dashboard use, data-driven decision making |
| Training \& change management | Teaching/coaching, communication, empathy, resistance management |
| Human-AI collaboration | Creative problem-solving, critical thinking, collaboration with AI agents/tools |
| Regulatory compliance \& ethics | Data protection knowledge, process documentation, ethical AI governance |

### Belgium’s Outlook

- **Labor market demands are clearly shifting:** Employers expect ongoing upskilling in digital/automation domains and deeply value soft skills, not just technical credentials[^5_10][^5_9][^5_11].
- **Government policy and EU targets** stress the importance of increasing digital competences across all sectors, not only classic IT or engineering environments[^5_12].
- **Job titles may change** (automation facilitator, AI trainer, business technologist), but the need for hybrid profiles—combining business acumen, digital tools, and strong people skills—will keep rising.


### Two Verifiable Sources

- [PwC Belgium 2025: Rise in AI Jobs and related 25% wage increases, exposes need for more AI training][^5_9]
- [Belgium - Digital Decade Strategic Roadmap 2030 (Ministry of the Economy)][^5_12]

These trends suggest that in Belgium, the real winners will be those who *continuously adapt,* blending automation skills, business process thinking, and strong interpersonal capabilities to guide their organizations through digital transformation.

# What examples exist of AI-driven process improvements in Belgian non-tech departments

Examples of AI-driven process improvements in Belgian non-tech departments, particularly in Antwerp and beyond, include:

1. **Public Sector Automation and AI Enablement (Digitally Enabled Government):**
    - Digitaal Vlaanderen, a Flemish government agency, collaborates with firms like KPMG to deploy AI tools like Microsoft Copilot to support administrative employees. They have been automating benefit grants (e.g., 85% of the Groeipakket child benefit is granted automatically without citizen action).
    - AI enables proactive public services by automating repetitive tasks, supporting decision-making, and improving communication with citizens and businesses.
    - This includes pilot programs for staff training on AI prompting and establishing frameworks for ethical and efficient AI deployment in public administration[^6_12][^6_13].
2. **Maritime and Industrial Operations (CMB.TECH NV, Antwerp):**
    - CMB.TECH, a large Belgian maritime group headquartered in Antwerp, uses AI and automation to improve operational performance and reduce emissions through investments in hydrogen fuels and modern vessels.
    - While primarily technical, their operations have impacted non-technical administrative workflows related to compliance, monitoring, and reporting through integrated digital solutions and AI-supported analytics.
    - They also incorporate cybersecurity automation and continuous endpoint monitoring in their IT landscape, optimizing incident management[^6_2].
3. **Supply Chain and Manufacturing AI Use Cases (Benelux Context):**
    - Companies like Reynaers and Kapernikov implement AI for forecasting and quality inspection, showing how AI supports efficiency in production and operational tasks that indirectly affect non-technical departments by improving data-driven decision-making and reducing manual quality controls[^6_9].
4. **General AI Adoption in Non-Tech Business Functions:**
    - Belgian firms increasingly apply AI for automating payroll, personnel planning, and other administrative tasks, making internal operations more efficient and reducing manual repetitive workload in finance, HR, and legal departments[^6_11][^6_18].

These examples indicate that AI-driven improvements in Belgian non-tech departments focus heavily on automating routine administrative tasks, supporting decision logic with AI tools, improving service delivery to citizens or customers, and embedding AI within existing digital ecosystems without requiring deep technical skills from the end users.

If you want detailed company-specific examples or examples from other sectors, I can further elaborate.

# How have Belgian non-tech departments implemented AI for process improvements

Belgian non-technical departments have implemented AI-driven process improvements mainly by automating repetitive administrative tasks, enhancing decision support, and improving service delivery, especially in the public administration and industrial sectors. Key examples and approaches include:

- **Public Administration:** Belgian public sector entities, notably agencies like Digitaal Vlaanderen and federal public services, have deployed AI tools such as Microsoft Copilot to automate administrative processes. This has led to automation of benefit grants—for instance, 85% of the Groeipakket child benefit is now automatically granted—which reduces manual workloads and frees civil servants for higher-value tasks. AI is also used for supporting complex decision-making and personalizing services for citizens. Efforts include pilot programs for AI prompting training and establishing ethical governance frameworks to safely scale AI use in public services[^7_1][^7_4][^7_5][^7_6].
- **Industrial and Maritime Operations:** Companies like CMB.TECH NV, based in Antwerp, leverage AI and automation to optimize compliance reporting, operational workflows, and cybersecurity monitoring. Their digital transformation efforts include continuous endpoint monitoring with AI-driven cybersecurity tools and integration of AI in operational analytics. While these applications primarily support technical functions, they have significant impact on non-technical administrative and operational processes as well[^7_2][^7_11][^7_12][^7_18].
- **Supply Chain and Manufacturing:** Organizations in the Benelux region, including Belgium, apply AI for forecasting, quality inspection, and predictive analytics that indirectly improve non-technical functions like planning and compliance. These AI-driven improvements reduce manual quality controls, improve operational efficiency, and enhance decision-making[^7_2].
- **Cross-Departmental Workflow Automation:** Belgian firms increasingly apply AI in non-tech business functions such as payroll, personnel planning, and regulatory compliance, which automate routine tasks and optimize internal operations in finance, HR, and legal departments. This broad adoption is supported by practical employee training programs emphasizing on-the-job AI tool application, ensuring integration beyond just technical teams[^7_3][^7_5].
- **Regulatory and Data Exchange Processes:** Belgian financial institutions and tax administrations utilize AI for automating large-scale, international data exchange and compliance reporting in accordance with EU directives, such as the Common Reporting Standard (CRS), enhancing accuracy and efficiency in non-technical compliance roles[^7_13].

Overall, Belgian non-tech departments implement AI by blending automation of routine, rule-based administrative tasks with AI-driven analytics and decision support. They emphasize staff training, ethical governance, and integration within existing digital ecosystems, aiming to augment employee productivity and service quality rather than replace human roles[^7_1][^7_3][^7_5][^7_6].

If desired, I can provide more specific company cases or sectoral examples illustrating these AI-driven process improvements in detail.

# What challenges do Belgian non-tech departments encounter with AI adoption

Belgian non-technical departments face several challenges when adopting AI for process improvements, including:

1. **Skills and Knowledge Gaps:**
Many non-tech staff and managers lack sufficient AI literacy and practical skills to use and implement AI tools effectively. There is a large disparity between early adopters with AI expertise and the broader workforce, especially in SMEs. This creates a barrier to uptake and scaling AI solutions across departments[^8_13][^8_10].
2. **Complex Regulatory Environment:**
Strict and complex EU and Belgian regulations around data privacy, cloud computing, and AI compliance create uncertainty. Public sector organizations in particular hesitate to adopt AI because of fears of breaking rules and regulatory risk. Fragmented decision-making exacerbates this issue, leading to pilot projects without scalable results[^8_12][^8_8].
3. **Cultural and Organizational Resistance:**
Many civil servants and employees express fear regarding AI, including concerns about job security and distrust towards AI systems. There is also resistance to changing established workflows and ways of working, making AI integration difficult without strong internal support and change management[^8_9][^8_16][^8_13].
4. **Fragmented and Slow Diffusion of Innovation:**
While some large organizations in Belgium have embraced AI, smaller enterprises and many departments lag behind. The national AI adoption landscape evidences a "two-speed" economy with a gap between an innovative vanguard and a broad base of organizations struggling to adopt[^8_13].
5. **IT Infrastructure and Vendor Lock-in:**
Limitations in digital infrastructure, including uneven fiber and 5G coverage, reduce the practical benefits of cloud-based AI tools. Additionally, risks of vendor lock-in and hidden costs in procurement discourage investment in AI solutions[^8_12][^8_13].
6. **Lack of Scalable AI Solutions:**
Organizations often run isolated pilot AI projects without integration into wider workflows or clear scaling strategies. Fragmented decision-making and inadequate strategic coordination limit moving from experimentation to full AI adoption[^8_11][^8_12].
7. **Training and Change Management Needs:**
Successful AI adoption demands investment in training non-technical staff to use AI tools confidently and understanding their limitations. There is a recognized need for ongoing upskilling and human-AI collaboration abilities to maximize AI benefits[^8_10][^8_14][^8_12].

In summary, Belgian non-tech departments must overcome challenges related to skills, regulatory complexity, employee fears, infrastructure limitations, fragmented organizational strategies, and change management to realize AI’s full potential in process improvements.

These insights emerge from recent Belgian government studies, consultancy reports (Implement Consulting Group), EY and Deloitte surveys, and observations on AI adoption trends[^8_8][^8_9][^8_10][^8_11][^8_12][^8_13][^8_14]. If needed, I can cite or summarize specific examples or suggest ways organizations are addressing these challenges.

# How have Belgian non-tech departments implemented AI for process improvements

Belgian non-technical departments have implemented AI for process improvements primarily by automating repetitive administrative tasks, enhancing decision support, and improving service delivery, with a strong focus on public administration and some industrial sectors. Here are the key ways AI is being used:

1. **Public Sector Automation and Service Efficiency:**
    - Agencies like *Digitaal Vlaanderen* and federal public services use AI tools, including Microsoft Copilot, to automate tasks such as benefit granting (e.g., automating 85% of Groeipakket child benefit approvals), reducing manual workloads for civil servants and allowing staff to focus on higher-value activities.
    - AI assists with personalized services, repetitive task automation, harmful content detection, and decision-making support involving complex data.
    - Training programs exist for staff on AI prompting, alongside ethical AI governance frameworks to ensure transparency and trust.
    - Recent studies estimate a €4 billion opportunity for Belgium’s public administration from generative AI adoption, with 71% of public administration jobs having AI complementarity potential[^10_1][^10_4][^10_5][^10_6].
2. **Industrial and Maritime Operations (Example: CMB.TECH NV in Antwerp):**
    - CMB.TECH uses AI to optimize operational performance, compliance reporting, cybersecurity (continuous endpoint monitoring, automated vulnerability scanning), and integrates AI in analytics to improve workflows beyond purely technical functions, including administrative processes.
    - Investments in digital transformation support efficiency and emissions reductions, enabling more effective operational and administrative management[^10_11][^10_12].
3. **Cross-Departmental Workflow Automation in Private Firms:**
    - AI is increasingly applied in non-tech business functions such as payroll, personnel planning, and compliance reporting, automating routine tasks and improving decision-making in finance, HR, and legal departments. Practical training and on-the-job AI skill development aid integration beyond IT teams[^10_3][^10_5].
    - Belgian companies leverage AI for quality inspection and supply chain forecasting in manufacturing, indirectly benefiting non-technical roles by reducing manual workload and improving data-driven decisions[^10_2].
4. **Compliance Automation in Finance and Tax:**
    - Belgian financial institutions and tax administrations implement AI for automating large-scale data exchange and compliance with EU tax directives (e.g., Common Reporting Standard - CRS, DAC2), ensuring accuracy in reporting and reducing manual work in non-technical compliance roles[^10_11][^10_13][^10_18].

In summary, Belgian non-tech departments implement AI by blending automation of repetitive administrative processes with decision support enhancements and service personalization. This adoption is accompanied by ongoing staff training, ethical AI usage frameworks, and integration within existing digital workflows, focused on augmenting employee productivity rather than replacing roles.

If you want, I can provide more sector-specific or company-level examples.

# 🧠 Master_Report_Business_Technology_Consultant_28-08-2025.md

## 1. Professional Identity and Strategic Differentiator
- **Role:** Business Technology Consultant specialized in **applied AI, automation, and low/no-code tools**.  
- **Unique proposition:** Not a full-stack developer or sysadmin, but a **bridge between business and technology**. Acts as the **“last mile”**: implements, connects, and trains so clients see results in days/weeks, not months.  
- **Geography:** Belgium, focused on Antwerp, but open to Europe (French/Dutch + English markets).  
- **ICP (Ideal Customer Profile):**
  - SMEs in logistics, retail, services, agencies, and public sector.  
  - Non-technical teams already using Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 but underutilizing their potential.  
  - Agencies/consultancies that need AI services but lack internal experts.  
- **Main client pain points:** manual processes, information silos, slow reporting, task duplication, lack of know-how in AI/automation.  
- **What you deliver:** speed, clarity, tangible results, vendor independence, and training so clients don’t depend on you long-term.

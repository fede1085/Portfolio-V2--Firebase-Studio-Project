📋 **Executive Summary - Federico's Portfolio Architecture Learning Session**

---

### 🎯 Project Context
- **Portfolio**: Next.js/React personal portfolio for Business Technology Consulting  
- **Goal**: Understanding modern web development structure through VibeCoding approach  
- **Background**: Federico transitioning from traditional HTML/CSS to the React ecosystem  

---

### 🔍 Key Knowledge Gaps Identified
- **Layout vs Page confusion** – Difference between template structure and content  
- **Component architecture** – How React components combine HTML/CSS/JS  
- **Data flow** – Understanding `data.ts` as a content source vs hardcoded HTML  
- **Development workflow** – Local preview (`npm run dev`) vs Firebase deployment  
- **React fundamentals** – JavaScript generating HTML dynamically  

---

### 📚 Learning Progress Made
- **Layout** = Frame/Template (navigation, footer, global structure)  
- **Page** = Content (specific landing page content)  
- **Components** = LEGO blocks (Header, Hero, Projects as reusable pieces)  
- **data.ts** = Content management (projects, bio, links in JavaScript format)  
- **Tailwind CSS** replaces Bootstrap grid system  

---

### 🚦 Current Status
**Ready for**: Practical hands-on exploration  

**Next steps needed**:
1. See actual `data.ts` file structure  
2. Practice local development workflow  
3. Make first content modification  

---

### 🔧 Technical Stack Confirmed
- **Frontend**: Next.js/React + Tailwind CSS  
- **Hosting**: Firebase  
- **Development**: VS Code + local preview  
- **Architecture**: Component-based modular structure

### ❓ Open Questions for Project Continuation
- Hands-on `data.ts` exploration  
- Local development setup verification  
- First practical modification exercise

# Master Prompt â€“ Deep Repository Analysis & Context Engineering Reports

You are connected to my GitHub repository.  
Your task is to perform a **deep search and full-context analysis** across all files and folders.  
Act as multiple professional roles (Project Manager, Software Architect, QA Engineer, Technical Writer).  
Generate **structured Markdown reports** with clear headings, bullet points, and tables when useful.  
Each report must be detailed, actionable, and ready to be stored as context for other AI agents (e.g., Gemini Code Assistant, IDE assistants).  
Avoid vague answers; provide professional-level deliverables.

## Reports to Generate

### 1. Project Scope Report
- Explain what the project currently does.  
- Identify explicit and implicit scope (what is in-scope and out-of-scope).  
- List dependencies (internal modules and external libraries/APIs).  
- Highlight potential risks, assumptions, and missing pieces.  

### 2. Architecture & Information Flow Report
- Map main modules, folders, and files.  
- Explain how components interact (data flow, event flow, dependencies).  
- Identify bottlenecks, redundant structures, or duplicated CTAs.  
- Provide simplified diagrams in Markdown (mermaid.js) if possible.  

### 3. Testing Coverage Report
- Identify existing tests (unit, integration, e2e).  
- Highlight areas of the codebase that lack testing.  
- Suggest critical functions that require immediate coverage.  
- Provide recommendations for testing frameworks and strategies.  

### 4. Documentation Gaps Report
- Analyze all README files, inline comments, and documentation.  
- Point out missing or outdated documentation.  
- Suggest where additional explanation is required for onboarding.  
- Identify opportunities for developer guides, contribution docs, or architecture overviews.  

## Final Output Requirements
- Deliver each report separately, clearly labeled.  
- Use structured Markdown formatting.  
- Prioritize **clarity, depth, and actionability**.  
- Ensure the output can be used as a **professional project deliverable**.  
- Maintain consistency across all reports.
